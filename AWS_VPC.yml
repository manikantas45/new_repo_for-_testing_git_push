What Is Amazon VPC? 
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined.
- Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

IP Classses:
Class A: 10.10.10.1
Class B: 172.16.0.1
Class C: 192.168.0.1

VPC CIDR: 10.10.0.0/16

IPv4 in VPC:
You can have multiple VPCs in CIDR block for the VPC from 10.10.0.0/16 to 10.10.0.0/28 range

we are choosing 10.1.0.0/24

Number of IP address -> 2^(32-24) -> 2⁸ -> 256

Assuming equal number of IP addresses for the each subnet,

Number of IP addresses for a subnet = 256/4 = 64

Here is the IP address distribution for the above 4 subnets

Public Subnet 1 -> 10.1.0.0/26 (IP range — 10.1.0.0 to 10.1.0.63)

Public Subnet 2 -> 10.1.0.64/26 (IP range — 10.1.0.64 to 10.1.0.127)

Private Subnet 1-> 10.1.0.128/26 (IP range — 10.1.0.128 to 10.1.0.191)

Private Subnet 2 ->10.1.0.192/26 (IP range — 10.1.0.192 to 10.1.0.255)
    
a region (max is 5 per region, but it is a soft limit)

Assignment: AWS services limit per account

Subnet Range Caculation Link: https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html


Max CIDR per VPC is 5. For each CIDR
min size is /28: 16 IP addresses
max size is /16: 65536 IP addresses
Your VPC CIDR should not overlap with your other networks

AWS reserves 5 IPs (first 4 and last 1 in your IP ranges) in each subnet. 
These 5 IPs are not available for usage and cannot be assigned to an instance.
For example, if your CIDR block is 10.0.0.0/24, then the reserved IPs are:

10.1.0.0: Network address
10.1.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
10.1.0.2: Reserved by AWS for mapping to AWS-provided DNS
10.1.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future usage
10.1.0.255: Network broadcast address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC

Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon Resources: (ex: ec2, rds, cache, efs etc)
Major topics:
 1.Subnets
 2.NACL
 3.Internet Gateway 
 4.NAT gateways
 5.Route tables 
 6.Security Group 
 

1. Subnets:
- A range of IP address in your VPC
- An IP address has numbers that identify the network ID and the host ID.

   a.Public Subnets: If a subnet has route table to an aws Internet Gateway it is called a public subnet.
   b.Private Subnets: If a subnet has route table to an aws Nat Gateway it is called a private subnet or doesn't have route to Internet Gateway.
  

2. NaCL: 
- A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. 
  a.Public Nacl: If a acl has public subnet associations it is called a public Nacl
  b.Private Nacl: If a Nacl has private subnet associations it is called a private Nacl

3.Internet Gateway(IGW): 
- Internet Gateway (IGW) allows instances with public IPs to access the internet

4.Nat Gateway (NAT):
- NAT stands for Network Address Translation
- NAT Gateway does something similar to Internet Gateway (IGW), but it only works one way, 
  Instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC and also external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances

5.Route Tables: 
- A route table containsa set of rules,called routes,that are used to determine where network traffic is directed
- Each subnet in our VPC must be associated with a route table,the table controls the routing for the subnet
- A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time,but we can associate multiple subnets with the same route table

  a.Public RouteTable:  If a subnet has associated with public route table it is called a Public RouteTable
  b.Private RouteTable:  If a subnet has associated with private route table it is called a private RouteTable 

6 Security Group:
- Security Group - security layer to EC2 instances that control both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level
- Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level


Interview Questions:

Q1)what is the differences between Nacl and Security Group?

Nacl:
1. It supports both allow and deny rules, and by default, all the rules are denied. You need to add the rule which you can either allow or deny it
2. Network ACLs are stateless. This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will not beapplied to the outgoing rule. 
   e.g. If you allow an incoming port 80, you would also need to apply the rule for outgoing traffic.
3. It is associated with a subnet
4. Rules are evaluated in order, starting from the lowest number
5. NACL has applied automatically to all the instances which are associated with an instance
6. It is the second layer of defense

Security Group:
1. It supports only allow rules, and by default, all the rules are denied. You cannot deny the rule for establishing a connection
2. Security groups are stateful. This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will be automatically applied to the outgoing rule.
   e.g. If you allow an in coming port 80, the outgoing port 80 will be automatically opened..
3. It is associated with an EC2 instance
4. All the rules are evaluated before deciding whether to allow the traffic.
5. Security Group is applied to an instance only when you specify a security group while launching an instance.
6. It is the first layer of defense. 


What is the  differences between Public IP Address and Private Address?
Public IP Address:
1. External(Global)reach
2. Used for communicating outside  your private network, over the internet
3. Found by Googling "what is my IP address"
4. Assigned and controlling by your internt service provider
5. Not free
6. Any number not included in the reserved private IP address range  Ex=8.8.8.8

 Private IP Address:
 1. Internal(local) reach
 2. Used for communicating within your private network, with other devices in the same network.
 3. Found via your devices's internal settings
 4. Assigned to your specific device within a private Network
 5. free
 6. Private IP ranges
 - 10.0.0.0. to 10.255.255.255
 - 172.16.0.0 to 172.3.255.255
 - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
